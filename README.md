# Sales_Data_SQL_Jupyter

This repository demonstrates how to perform sales data analysis using SQL and Python within a Jupyter Notebook environment. It consists of two main files: 

1. sales_data.db : a sample SQLite database containing sales data with columns such as date, name, product, quantity, and price.
2. sales_data.ipynb : a Jupyter Notebook that guides users through connecting to the SQLite database and querying the data using SQL.


The notebook provides step-by-step instructions for analyzing total sales, revenue, and quantity sold, as well as visualizing the results using bar charts and stacked bar charts with matplotlib and pandas. This project is designed to give users a hands-on experience in integrating SQL queries within Python, making it a great starting point for anyone looking to learn how to manipulate and visualize data from SQL databases using Jupyter Notebooks.
